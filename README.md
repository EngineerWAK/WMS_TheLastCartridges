# WMS_theLastCartridges

Mission file for Arma 3 Dedicated Server

"v1.51_2022MAR26_MoltenTungsten_GitHub"
Doesn't include any AI/Mission but ready to work with WMS_InfantryProgram
This version of the Framework include:

    CHVD - for viewDistance setup
    Igiload - to carry crate/vehicles around
    R3F_LOG - to carry crate/statics around
    3 client side files for Infistar Arma3
    WMS_InfantryProgram mpmission files
    And some old Crap which need to be cleaned...

you will need at least CBA, ACE3, RHS AFRF/USAF/GREF
CfgSounds and custom\ogg will certainly change
